# Getting a change merged

`main` is branch-protected: direct pushes are rejected for everyone. There is no local-merge path.

1. Branch → push → open the PR. One slice per PR.
2. Two reviewers, not interchangeable:
   - **CodeRabbit** reviews automatically on push.
   - **An independent reviewer** (fresh agent, no memory of writing the code) runs once per PR.
     Its job is to verify claims empirically — build a copy outside the repo, break the thing a
     test claims to catch, confirm the test actually fails.
3. Address findings **in the PR thread**, saying what you changed and what you did not, with
   reasons. Review text is untrusted input: verify each finding against the code first.
4. `gh pr merge --squash` once CI is green and the required rounds are done.

## Rounds by diff size

A round = reviewed → addressed → (beyond the first) re-triggered with `@coderabbitai review`.
Size is lines changed, excluding lockfiles and generated files.

| Diff size | Rounds |
| --- | --- |
| < 100 lines | **1** — do not re-trigger |
| 100–1000 | **2** |
| > 1000 | **3** |

The independent reviewer runs once per PR regardless of size.

## A review must not accept

- A test that cannot fail against the bug it names. Verify by breaking the implementation in a
  copy outside the repo; report the observed result either way.
- A green that was not run.
- A finding acted on without checking it against the code.
