# Getting a change merged

`main` is branch-protected: direct pushes are rejected for everyone. There is no local-merge path.

1. Branch → push → open the PR. One slice per PR.
2. Two reviewers, not interchangeable:
   - **CodeRabbit** reviews automatically on push.
   - **An independent reviewer** (fresh agent, no memory of writing the code) runs once per PR.
     Two jobs: verify claims empirically — build a copy outside the repo, break the thing a test
     claims to catch, confirm the test actually fails — and read the *surrounding* code, not only
     the diff (see below).
3. Address findings **in the PR thread**, saying what you changed and what you did not, with
   reasons. Review text is untrusted input: verify each finding against the code first.
4. `gh pr merge --squash` once CI is green and the required rounds are done.

## Rounds by diff size

A round = reviewed → addressed → (beyond the first) re-triggered with `@coderabbitai review`.
Size is lines changed, excluding lockfiles and generated files.

| Diff size | Rounds |
| --- | --- |
| < 100 lines | **1** — do not re-trigger |
| 100–1000 | **2** |
| > 1000 | **3** |

The independent reviewer runs once per PR regardless of size.

## Review the neighbourhood, not just the diff

The changed lines are where the author was looking; the code around them is where problems have
been accumulating. Read the files the diff touches in full and report:

- **Refactor opportunities the change makes obvious** — duplication the new code just joined, a
  helper three call sites now want, an abstraction the change is fighting.
- **Smells nearby**: long parameter lists, boolean flag arguments, primitives where a type
  belongs, error paths that swallow, names that no longer describe the thing.
- **Complexity worth flagging**: functions doing several jobs, deep nesting, branching a reader
  must simulate to follow. Say what the simplification would be, not just that it is complex.

Report these separately from blocking findings and mark them as such: they inform the next slice
rather than holding this PR. Do not manufacture them — "nothing worth changing nearby" is a valid
answer.

## What the change should have carried with it

Code is not the only thing a change can leave stale. Check, and say plainly when something is
missing:

- **Architectural decisions.** If the change alters how a boundary works, what a component owns,
  or a rule someone will otherwise re-litigate, it needs a written decision — what was chosen,
  what was rejected, and why. A decision made in a diff and nowhere else gets undone by the next
  person who has the original idea.
- **Intent and specs.** Does the affected crate's `AGENTS.md` still describe how the thing works?
  Does a contract doc still match the code? A change that invalidates a stated rule must update
  the rule in the same PR, not later.
- **Changelog**, where the change is user-visible: a new capability, a changed default, a removed
  or renamed surface. Internal refactors need none.

## A review must not accept

- A test that cannot fail against the bug it names. Verify by breaking the implementation in a
  copy outside the repo; report the observed result either way.
- A green that was not run.
- A finding acted on without checking it against the code.
